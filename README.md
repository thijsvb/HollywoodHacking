##Fake hacking to impress people that only see terminals in movies.

Hacking in movies and tv series is often ridiculously fake. Of course they just do this to make it look more exciting, but a lot of people actually believe that's what hacking looks like.

Also a lot of people seem to think programming and hacking are virtually (see what I did there) the same thing. When people know I'm a programmer, they'll sometimes ask stuff like "Can't you just hack the school website?". 

Taking advantage of these assumptions I made 'HollywoodHacking'; a Proccesing sketch that'll make any screen look like one in a blockbuster action movie. I like running it on my phone, just because that makes it even less likely to be actually real.
